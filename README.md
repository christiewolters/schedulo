Team Java Grinders:

Our proposal is a shift management system which allows retail employees to add available shifts and view their scheduled shifts, managers to create a schedule based on available shifts, 
and a store manager to add stores which contain managers and retail employees.

The user will have a set of hours to choose from (opening to closing), a maximum number of hours per shift (9 including a lunch), and a day of the week to choose from. 
Repetition by the same employee won't be allowed, but overlapping shifts by both the same and other employees will be.
Schedules will be displayed on a weekly basis, in a calendar-esque format.

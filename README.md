Team Java Grinders:

Our proposal is a shift management system which allows retail employees to add available shifts and view their scheduled shifts, managers to create a schedule based on available shifts, 
and a store manager to add stores which contain managers and retail employees.

The user will have a range of hours to choose from (opening to closing) and a day of the week to choose from. The user will put in their hours of availability, and the manager will decide their shift for them based on those hours. 
Repetition by the same employee won't be allowed, but overlapping shifts with other employees will be.
Schedules will be displayed on a weekly basis, in a calendar-esque format.
